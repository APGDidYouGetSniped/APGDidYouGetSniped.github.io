<div>I started War Brokers in 2018. I found it on crazy games one day. My nickname at the time was Grand Admiral. In mid-2018 I joined the WB discord. In 2019 I joined the amazing PSD squad run by Fazzywazz at the time. Late in 2019, I think December I created the squad TFA. TFA stood for TriForce Alliance. I ran it until early 2021 when after a long time of not playing, I forgot my password to log in. Since then I created another account. ([APG] Did You Get Sniped?) Then late in October 2021, I created the APG squad.&nbsp;</div>
